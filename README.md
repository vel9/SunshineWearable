#Android Developer Nanodegree: Project 6

Wearable integration with Udacity's Sunshine App.

The Sunshine App, which the wearable leverages for updated weather data, was developed in these two awesome courses by Udacity/Google:

[Developing Android Apps, Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853)
[Advanced Android App Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855)

Core wearable integration code can be found at the following locations:
